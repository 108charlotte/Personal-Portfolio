# Personal-Portfolio
## Description
This is my simple static html + css portfolio website! I plan to host it on www.charlottewoodrum.dev, the domain that I got from hack club's high seas event--thank you so much for that! This project will serve as a way to route people to my individual projects and introduce myself to them! 

## Credits
I used bootstrap for my CSS styling. 

I also used chatgpt to generate some simple navbar code using bootstrap. 

## Setup
If you want to host this website on your own computer, first: open a copied version of the github repo in your editor of choice. Next, download liveserver if you haven't already. Then, two-finger click on any of the html files, and select open with liveserver. It should automatically open the website in your browser!
